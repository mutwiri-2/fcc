        <h2>iphone 11 Pro Max</h2>
        <p>The biggest iPhone in Apple's lineup, the iPhone 11 Pro Max looks like an incremental upgrade over the iPhone XS Max but it brings some significant changes under the hood. There's a triple camera setup at the back now, letting you choose between the Wide, Ultra Wide, and Telephoto lenses.

        The Camera app makes it seamless to pick one or the other, presenting the Ultra Wide camera as a 0.5x zoom, which is certainly an interesting perspective. All this is backed by improved HDR and a brand new Night Mode, which means you get excellent image and video quality in most conditions. For the first time in years, Apple's phones not only compete, but often surpass the competition in terms of low light photography.</p>
